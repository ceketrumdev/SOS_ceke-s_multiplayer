# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently **work-in-progress** and **not released as a stable, in-game functional mod yet**.

Security fixes are provided only for:
- The **default branch** (`main`) and the most recent commits

Older commits, forks, or unofficial builds are **not** supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security issues through public GitHub issues.

Instead, use one of these options (in this order):

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (recommended)  
   If this repository has it enabled, use:  
   **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**

2. If private reporting is not available, contact the maintainer **privately** (e.g., via a direct message where you already reach them or contact ferrando.ryan.mickael@gmail.com ).  

### What to include
To help reproduce and fix the issue quickly, include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected commit hash / file paths
- Your environment (OS, game version, mod version/commit)
- Any logs or crash reports (remove secrets)

### Response timeline (best effort)
Because this is a small WIP project, response times may vary, but the goal is:
- **Initial acknowledgement:** within **7 days**
- **Status update:** within **14 days** after acknowledgement (or sooner if urgent)

### Disclosure policy
- Please give maintainers a reasonable opportunity to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- If accepted, we will coordinate a fix and, when possible, publish a brief advisory / release note.

## Scope
This policy covers:
- Vulnerabilities in this repository’s code and build scripts

It does **not** cover:
- Third-party dependencies (please also report upstream when relevant)
- Issues caused by modified builds or unofficial distributions
